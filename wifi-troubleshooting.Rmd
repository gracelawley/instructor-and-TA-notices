# Wifi Troubleshooting

__Problem:__

Can connect to the conference wifi successfully but some/all webpages won't load. 

__Things to try:__

1. Turn on airplane mode for ~30 seconds and then reconnect to the wifi (causes wifi to forget your computer and assign you a new IP address)
1. Renew DHCP lease (same as above)
    + Mac: *Open Network Preferences*, *Advanced*, *TCP IP*, *Renew DHCP Lease*
1. Disconnect and reconnect to wifi
1. Try a different browser
1. Restart your computer
1. Double check that you are using the conference wifi and not the hotel wifi


# Other notes:

* `devtools::install_github(...)` fails with an error message saying: "Error: HTTP error 403. API rate limit exceeded for..."
  + Meaning: there are too many people also installing packages from GitHub at the moment. Try again in 5 minutes and see if you have any luck.
